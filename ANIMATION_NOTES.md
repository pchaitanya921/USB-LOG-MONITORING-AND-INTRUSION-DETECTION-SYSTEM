# Animation Performance Notes

## CSS Animation Performance

The CSS animations in this project use properties like `transform` which can trigger layout recalculations. While these work well for most modern browsers, here are some tips for optimizing performance:

1. Use the `will-change` property to hint the browser about animations:
   ```css
   .scan-line-demo {
     will-change: transform;
   }
   ```

2. Prefer animating `transform` and `opacity` over other properties when possible.

3. For complex animations, consider using `requestAnimationFrame` in JavaScript instead of CSS animations.

## Browser Compatibility

For maximum browser compatibility:

1. Always include vendor prefixes for experimental CSS properties:
   ```css
   -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(5px);
   backdrop-filter: blur(5px);
   ```

2. Test animations in multiple browsers, especially Safari which may require additional prefixes.

3. Consider providing fallbacks for browsers that don't support certain CSS features.

## Accessibility

When using animations:

1. Respect user preferences for reduced motion:
   ```css
   @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
     .scan-line-demo {
       animation: none;
     }
   }
   ```

2. Ensure animations don't interfere with screen readers or keyboard navigation.

3. Provide alternative content for users who may have animations disabled.
